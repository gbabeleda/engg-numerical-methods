# numerical-methods-engineering

This repository is for me to refresh my knowledge on the numerical methods for engineering. Ive taken a subject covering this previously in my Masters Degree, but I cannot find my past materials, or remember how to do the methods. 

Additionally, I cannot really remember if we covered what are the applications of these methods. 

Im the kind of person who learns the best by seeing the overall context that each method is used, so this repository will contain the following:

- An explanation of the field, the methods, and how the methods work
- python code that use these methods to solve problems
- using that python code in specific applications in fields that I am interested in like Data Science, Materials Engineering, and Energy Engineering

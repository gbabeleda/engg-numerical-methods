# numerical-methods-engineering

This repository will cover my attempts at solving numerical methods in engineering problems using python and jupyter notebooks.

The goal is to create scripts that allow us to solve problems using the specific methods in question. 

I have previously taken a course in numerical methods in my masters degree, ES 204, but no longer recall the lessons and dont have any of my solutions. 

This repository will be my attempt to rectify that. The structure will be based on the syllabus of ES 204. 

When possible, solutions to real world engineering problems will be attempted

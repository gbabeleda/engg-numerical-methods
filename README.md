# numerical-methods-engineering

I have already taken a course in this during my masters degree, but I lost the course material and the files I wrote. I remember getting decent grades in it however. 

This repository will explore that subject again, and I will create scripts that can solve 






Additionally, I cannot really remember if we covered what are the applications of these methods. 

Im the kind of person who learns the best by seeing the overall context that each method is used, so this repository will contain the following:

- An explanation of the field, the methods, and how the methods work
- python code that use these methods to solve problems
- using that python code in specific applications in fields that I am interested in like Data Science, Materials Engineering, and Energy Engineering
